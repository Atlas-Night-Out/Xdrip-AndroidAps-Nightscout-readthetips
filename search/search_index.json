Fly_io for Nightscout Credit too:Big thanks to Robby, for the idea, links putting it together, implementing the installer, and testing everything with myself for the docs, and Robby for the tips. Upcoming changes made: Process:old heroku accout to a new Turbo Fly_io Account. So with all that, let\u2019s set up a free Turbo Account on Fly_io You will need to keep to the free Tier for this setup to be free, in you having a nightscout site again totaly free. This could change and we are not fully knowing for how long it will be free, all we know is as long as you stick to the free tire Requirements it should be free. Lets hope for life. Fly_io Account \u00b1 1. Setup Fly_io Account: By going to https://fly.io/launch/heroku or Fly_io Account 2. Fill in your organization name, pick a App name you would like (I have just done an example in the image above for these instruction!) and choose your Heroku app you used on Heroku You will then be asked to fill in your payment details Fill in your payment details, don't worry,you will not be charged if you keep to a free tier as outlined. 3. After filling in and setting up your payment details go back to the page you just come from before you filled in the payment details, and carry on the Deploying process from the Heroku site. This can take a while to do.. 4. Sit back have another cuppa. 5. Fly_io Dashboard You should now be able to see or be at your Fly_io Dashboard and be presented with your Hostname Host Name Dashboard We now need to setup Xdrip We need to use Xdrip to upload are CGM readings to Nightscout and it will need you to enter the correct URL in it's setting for Nightscout to start receiving readings from your CGM! You may use other software other than Xdrip+ but for this tutorial I will be using xdrip+ you will have to excuse me if I just put xdrip as I keep forgetiing to put the + 6. Set up xDrip to upload to your Nightscout Also see here if you like other wise carry on below!S Base URL - Set up xDrip to upload to your Nightscout \u00b1 This is what you need to do in xDrip on your master (Main) Mobile. a. Go to xDrip Settings \u2212> Cloud Upload \u2212> Nightscout Sync (REST-API) b. Select Enable at the top, if not already enabled. c. Tap on Base URL. Enter the following Url. Remeber yours will be different than what I show you here. You will need to add your Secret-API and your Host to the set out code! https:// ThisIsyourSecret-API @ thisisyourHostName /api/v1/ If you forgot or lose your secret-API it can be located at Heroku/ Settings/Config Vars and look down the list for API_SECRET This will now be located in a differrent place now within Fly_io Your Host name is located in your Fly_io Dashboard. d. (Reminder)Tap on Base URL. Enter the following. https://API-Secret@hostname/api/v1/ That\u2019s it. Your xDrip readings should now upload to your Nightscout web site. If you do not see levels after 5 mins, triple check the way you have added your Base URL correctly, it is very case sensitive!with no spaces 7. Set up xDrip uploader to go to your AndroidAPS Basic settings for Most CGM This is the same has above except your Url will be your web address for Fly_io Host address, not like xdrip's where it has Both Secret and Fly_io host on one line with the added api/v1 at the end of it On AASP it is done seperatly, you add your Nightscout Web URL and then add your Secret in NS API secret below.There is no api/v1 in it a. Set your Nightscout URL e.g. https://yoursitesname.fly.dev/ b. You will also need to Disable Upload treatments and Back-fill data from xDrip+, or else treatments can be doubled in AAPS leading to false COB and IOB. c. Alert on failures should also be deactivated. These are in your settings/Cloud Upload/Nightscout Sync (REST-API) / Extra Options. d. Also Disable Automatic Calibration you can enable it for the first time but then after that it will need to be Disabled. you can do this by selecting the Download treatments to switch Automatic calibration (on/Off) You can do this at: Settings/Cloud Upload/Nightscout Sync (REST-API) / 8. Setting up xDrip as a (follower) like for your dad from the example from above This will be on your followers mobile phone, not your own. 1. In the xDrip Settings / Hardware Data Source, choose \u201cNightscout Follower\u201d as the hardware data source. See xdrip - Base URL for more information Issues or Concerns If you have any issues or concerns please post your questions in the Facebook Group or you can go to the Discussions on Github ## To Be continued!

Sit back have a cuppa and enjoy video waiting for your email to \u201cConfirm Account\u201d before you advance to the next section. e. Host Name You will be given a Hostname, that you will use to go to your nightscout site later and also add it to your settings and other things like when you setup a Follower. I will show you an example Host below. 2. Google Account a. You need a Google account to proceed. If you do not have one go to https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en and sign up or Google Account Once you have created a Google account Go to 3.

Free Tier virtual machine Spesifications you need to pick Free Tier Specifications to see the Specifications: Or go to https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features#free-tier I will give you the settings below is what I picked from the specifications list. For you to select in the next process you need to do. see Section 14. below now. The above three regions are the regions your virtual machine can be located, not where you have to be in living. In other words if you live in the U.K you still need to pick one of the three above. Oregon. Lowa, or South Carlolina to get a free Tier i. Process you need to do now Go to the dashboard. Select \u201cCompute Engine\u201d . Select the \u201cVM instances\u201d tab in the left pane if it\u2019s not already selected. Select \u201cCreate Instance\u201d. j. Settings you need to fill in Now: 1. Set name to \u201cnightscout\u201d. 2. Set machine type to \u201ce2-micro 1GB\u201d. 3. Select a region that qualifies for free tier . k. Go Down to Boot Disk Section : Edit it by clicking on change \u201cBoot Disk\u201d and modify as shown below. Click on \u201cSelect\u201d. 1. Ubunta . 2. Ubunta 20.04 LTS Minimal . x86/64, amd64 focal minimal image built on 2022-09-10, supports Shielded VM features 3. Standard Persistance Disk 4. 30GB Click on \u201cSelect\u201d. l. Under the firewall Section, a. enable both http and https . m. Click on \u201cCreate\u201d to start creating the virtual machine. Google will now bring up your virtual machine after its finished which will take a while, so sit back and relax. n. After the external IP address column is finished, click on \u201cSSH\u201d on the right side of the IP address. A terminal will appear shortly. This should bring up your browser, if it dosn't like it did not with me in firefox browser I had to allow popups for it to work! o. Copy and paste the following line into the terminal window that has just come up. Be very cautious not to copy it into any other machine as it will overwrite the contents of the machine. Copy the code below into teh teminal. curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamorham/nightscout-vps/vps-1/bootstrap.sh | bash You might get a pop up preventing you from opening the terminal window. If you do, select the options and allow the popups window. Then select the SSH again to open it. 4. Now Wrap up Linux installation a. If you get an error message that says (EINTEGRITY) ending with (0 bytes) and it hangs, just press CTRL and C keys at the same time to interrupt. Then, re-run the curl bootstrap command above that you have just entered into it again. You can use the up arrow on the terminal to go back to the previous command entries. b. After the installation is finalized, you will be asked to login. To log into the virtual machine, use the email address and password you used to register from when you did your Noip Account c. Terminal Process: Now Leave the update interval at 30. Select N for running command during update Enter email address \u201cused for urgent renewal Press A to accept the terms of service. Press N to decline sharing email address. Select 2 to redirect to secure https. If you want to copy your old nightscout site, please state the name here ( Example: https://site.herokuapp.com) To skip just press enter. I added my old Herroku account here. API secret: You will be asked to replace the API secret. This is the password you will login to Nightscout with later. Enter a password and take note of it and keep safe. It needs to be more than 12 characters long I would also not use symbols characters within making your password, I don't think xdrip likes it. Installation is Complete: When you see the following, the installation is complete and you can close the terminal by clicking on X at the top right corner of the terminal window. 5. Now We need to Set up Nightscout: Set up Nightscout: a. Use a web browser and copy your hostname from noip. And Paste it into your browser. (from when you registered at noip.com). b. This will bring up your Nightscout. It will ask you for a password. Enter your API-Secret you did earlier in the Google Cloud terminal. Check \u201cRemember this device\u201d checkbox to avoid having to re-enter it. c. On first time, Nightscout will ask you to set up a profile for sensitivity etc. Either enter real values or just click save and then use close button on top right of the screen. You may need to do this twice 6. Set up xDrip to upload to your Nightscout This is what you need to do in xDrip on your master (Main) phone. a. Go to xDrip Settings \u2212> Cloud Upload \u2212> Nightscout Sync (REST-API). b. Select Enable at the top. c. Let\u2019s say the hostname you chose when you signed up for noip.com was hostname. And let\u2019s say you set the API secret, while finalizing the installation as explained in the previous section, to API-Secret. d. Tap on Base URL. Enter the following. https://API-Secret@hostname/api/v1/ That\u2019s it. Your xDrip readings should now upload to your Nightscout on Google Cloud. If not triple check the way you have added your Base URL correctly, it is very case sensitive! 7. Set up xDrip uploader to go to your AndroidAPS Basic settings for Most CGM Warning! (I have not tested this bit on AndroidAPS so please report any issues if you have any. Links are at the bottom of the page!) This is the same has above except your Url will be your web address noip Host address, not like xdrip's where it has Both Secret and Noip host on one line, with the added api/v1 at the end of it. In AASP it is done separately, you add your Nightscout Web URL and then add your Secret in NS API secret below. There is no api/v1 in it at all. a. Set your Nightscout URL e.g. https://yoursitesname.ddns.net b. You will also need to Disable Upload treatments and Back-fill data from xDrip+, or else treatments can be doubled in AAPS leading to false COB and IOB. c. Alert on failures should also be deactivated. These are in your settings/Cloud Upload/Nightscout Sync (REST-API) / Extra Options. d. Also Disable Automatic Calibration you can enable it for the first time but then after that it will need to be Disabled. you can do this by selecting the Download treatments to switch Automatic calibration (on/Off) You can do this at: Settings/Cloud Upload/Nightscout Sync (REST-API) / 8. How to Configure DDNS (Dynamic DNS) in a Router a. Is another issue some of you may face if you do not have a static Ip address. There is software available for you to download from noip called a Dynamic update client . Which can be ok during the day while your computer is running but not so good at night if you wish to be saving power and turning your computer off, has this can and will stop your nightscout from running if your ip changes while your computer is off, making it an unsafe process for nightscout at night. b. The next video method is good for them that are able to use these router's but again some of us cannot use these methods and these kinds of router with a DHCP some are on routers that only have a DHCU c. This I found very frustrating to have to go through all of this due to some Service providers preventing you having a static Ip address. And this process I hope will help resolve a lot of them for you. But again, a cost in having to buy a second router! I did this setup running on a Hub 3.0 VMDG505/TG2492LG-VM 9. Create Acess Tokens and Roll Set up Nightscout tokens for your followers and AndroidAPS a. Go to your Web site Nightscout and verify again and verify API-Secret again if needed. See \"Now We need to Set up Nightscout\" above. And click on the top right menu button. b. Click on \"Admin Tools\" c. You will see seven predefined roles: Roles admin: full Access Readable: read-only access; no ability to make CarePortal/treatment entries. This user can view reports and profile information. Careportal: can view the site and make CarePortal/treatment entries Denied: no access (this role only works if the AUTH_DEFAULT_ROLES setting is also denied. You can\u2019t have a site that is readable to everyone and create a \u201cdenied\u201d token for a specific user.) Devicestatus-upload: used by devices. d. Make a Token Click the 'Add New Subject' e. In the form that opens, enter a name. Then under \u201cRoles\u201d, copy a role from the table. For example, for your dad that is only supposed to see your readings and nothing else and not be able to enter any other details or do anything else, then enter 'readable' in the roles section. You can enter a combination of different roles by separating them with \u201c,\u201d You can also add an optional comment if you like, and then click the save button. f. The token will be displayed. You can use it in two various ways: Now make sure to take a note of the access token, that you are given You can create multiple tokens with specific permissions for each. Note! Now make sure to take a note of the access token, that you are given. You can create multiple tokens with specific permissions for each. 10. Setting up xDrip as a (follower) like your dad, from the example above a. In the xDrip Data Source Settings, choose \u201cNightscout Follower\u201d as the hardware data source.

Delete your current cgm-remote-monitor fork using ( Video STEP !). 1. Hopfully you should now have 3 pages opened in your browser: Heroku, Atlas, and Github, Make sure you are logged-in on each one ( i.e. important ) before you continue. 2. Click Here or goto https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor, to open a new GitHub page. Click the on Fork icon in the top right 3. Wait for a moment 3.1. Scroll down the page and click Deploy to Heroku 4. Enter in your Heroku account a site name: invent a name you would like to use or see your BG in on the internet. Confirm that the name is available. 5. Don\u2019t change the region. 6. Scroll down and setup the following variables: You can come back to these later later by going to settings and config Vars Enable in Heroku! Note! The API_SECRET is the main password allowing full access to your Nightscout site. Make sure its secure (mix upper and lowercase letters, plus digits) and do no not share it publicly. If you think you exposed it by mistake, it is recommended that you change it. 7. API_SECRET will be your Nightscout site password, it needs to be at least 12 characters long and you should NOT use spaces if you use @ or ! symbol you should NOT use spaces if you use @ or ! symbols remember you will probably need to express them using Percent encoding in your uploader and downloader apps. If you're not sure on how to do this, it is recommended to use only letters (uppercase + lowercase) and digits . 8. If you want to link your Dexcom Share account as a data source, complete the following 3 lines: Warning! Common Errors MOST COMMON ERRORS The BRIDGE_PASSWORD and BRIDGE_USER_NAME are NOT visible from within your Dexcom app or online account. These values are what you entered into your Dexcom mobile app when you logged into that app for the VERY FIRST time. The BRIDGE_USER_NAME is not an email address. The most common error on initial Nightscout setups is that people incorrectly use an old account or an old password. To test your username and password, go to Dexcom's Clarity page (check here See Here for USA accounts and Here here for the others) and try logging in to your Dexcom account. If your account info isn't valid, or you don't see any data in your Clarity account... you need to figure out your actual credentials before moving ahead. 9. If you want to link your Care Link account as a data source (currently not functional with Heroku), complete the following lines: 10. Select the units you\u2019re using in DISPLAY_UNITS the acceptable choices are mg/dl or mmol/L (or just mmol when entering it). In my case I used mmol Plugins 11.

Now you need the connection string you defined during the Atlas cluster creation - Part 3 (as the example below, but not the string below). Copy and paste your! results into the MONGODB_URI variable field in Heroku vars. 13. I will try to give you an example about the way to do it again below, you can also see my video if you get stuck! A. In the boxes below 1st is your Atlas Account you gave yourself a User Name add it to the box below User Name on the left side! B. Then you also made a Database user Password add your Password you created for your database add this too into the box on the left side. C. And lastly you made up a Database Name , also add this to the last box on the left and click the Generate button which will generate your connection string code that you will need to add to your Heroku API I have given you my examples below on the right side of the boxes so just ignore them they are my examples to show you how the connection string is made up! username: Eg: username: Database password: Eg: Database password: @cluster0:xxxxx E.g: cluster0.xxxxx Database Name: E.g: Database Name: Generate D. After you have generated it, yours should look similar to the one below mine might be a little different to what yours should be so do check it carefully, and make sure to copy and paste it into notepad like I show you in the video below mongodb+srv:// : @cluster0. .mongodb.net/ ?retryWrites=true&w=majority My Connection String results mongodb+srv://nightkai:Madeuppassword7@cluster0.j2iil.mongodb.net/kdatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority Warning!

Once you have added your Connection string into the MongoDB_Uri. Scroll down to the bottom of the Config var list and click the Deploy APP You will WAIT until a while for them completion. Do not stop the process until it's complete. 15. click the View button and it should come up (if not, then click the Manage App -> Open App, in the top right corner) 16. Your Nightscout site should open and direct you to fill in profile editor for Nightscout. 17. All you need to fill in at this moment in time is your Time zone and eventually all the other fields e.g. Insulin to carbs. Make sure to not leave any fields empty. If you don't understand which value to use, just use the default value . a. You can come back and change these values later at any time by going to your Nightscout URL selecting the Hamberger icon on the right and selecting profile editor . 18. You will then need to go down to Authentication Status on the left and click Authentication. And enter your Heroku API secret you made earlier. Then click Authenticate button , Then save . Your Privacy warning! Anyone with your URL of your Nightscout site, can view your values and run reports of your data. It is recommended that you enable security to your site once you're done this setup. 19. Dexcom Share and CareLink users should see data working after a few minutes. Other uploaders like xDrip+ , Spike , xDrip4iOS, Gimp,Tomato etc will need to be setup with a Nightscout address and API secret in each Apps settings ( See Uploaders ). Nightscout Address for your Uploader Apps PAPERTRAIL a. Lastly, you might want to change the PAPERTRAIL_API_TOKEN line. Heroku gives you a free, tiny amount of Papertrail service (this is like a logging service for how the site is running), but this generates a lot of confusion to most people later on. when they get a message that their \"Free Papertrail Service has run out of room\". Papertrail is not needed at all, edit the line with the pensil icon and add DISABLED at the end, so that you can recover the function if you need it later. Congratulations Nightscout is now setup!
