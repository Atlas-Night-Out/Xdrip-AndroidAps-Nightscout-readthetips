Fly_io for Nightscout \u2301 Credit too: Big thanks to Robby, for the idea, links putting it together, implementing the installer, and testing everything with myself for the docs, and Robby for the tips. Upcoming changes made: \u2301 Process:old heroku account to a new Turbo Fly_io Account. If you already have a working Nightscout site working, there is no rush to switch to this yet. It is still in testing stages and improving this if we can. On testing this setup was easy and trouble free to me, only issues is on how to change your details of you need to as in your Config vars and secret password, which I will be looking into for you all! So with all that, let\u2019s set up a free Turbo Account on Fly_io \u2301 You will need to keep to the free Tier for this setup to be free, in you having a Nightscout site again totally free. This could change and we are not fully knowing for how long it will be free; all we know is as long as you stick to the free tire Requirements it should be free. Let\u2019s hope for life. Fly_io Account \u00b1 \u2301 1. Setup Fly_io Account: By going to https://fly.io/launch/heroku or Fly_io Account \u2301 2. Fill in your organization name, pick a App name you would like (I have just done an example in the image above for these instruction!) and choose your Heroku app you used on Heroku \u2301 You will then be asked to fill in your payment details Fill in your payment details, don't worry, you will not be charged if you keep to a free tier as outlined. 3. After filling in and setting up your payment details go back to the page you just come from before you filled in the payment details and carry on the Deploying process from the Heroku site. This can take a while to do. \u2301 4. Sit back have another cuppa. \u2301 5. Fly_io Dashboard \u2301 You should now be able to see or be at your Fly_io Dashboard and be presented with your Hostname Host Name Dashboard We now need to setup Xdrip \u2301 We need to use Xdrip to upload are CGM readings to Nightscout and it will need you to enter the correct URL in it's setting for Nightscout to start receiving readings from your CGM! You may use other software other than Xdrip+ but for this tutorial I will be using xdrip+ you will have to excuse me if I just put xdrip as I keep forgetting to put the + 6. Set up xDrip to upload to your Nightscout \u2301 You can also see the link below if you like other wise carry on below it! Base URL - Set up xDrip to upload to your Nightscout \u00b1 This is what you need to do in xDrip on your master (Main) Mobile. a. Go to xDrip Settings \u2212> Cloud Upload \u2212> Nightscout Sync (REST-API) \u2301 b. Select Enable at the top, if not already enabled. \u2301 c. Tap on Base URL. Enter the following URL. Remember yours will be different than what I show you here. You will need to add your Secret-API and your Host to the set out code! \u2301 https:// ThisIsyourSecret-API @ thisisyourHostName /api/v1/ If you forgot or lose your secret-API it can be located at Heroku/ Settings/Config Vars and look down the list for API_SECRET This can now be located in a different place now within Fly_io Your Host name is located in your Fly_io Dashboard. d. (Reminder)Tap on Base URL. Enter the following. https://API-Secret@hostname/api/v1/ \u2301 That\u2019s it. Your xDrip readings should now upload to your Nightscout web site. If you do not see levels after 5 mins, triple check the way you have added your Base URL correctly, it is very case sensitive! With no spaces 7. Set up xDrip uploader to go to your AndroidAPS \u2301 Basic settings for Most CGM \u2301 This is the same has above except your URL will be your web address for Fly_io Host address, not like xdrip's where it has Both Secret and Fly_io host on one line with the added api/v1 at the end of it On AASP it is done separately, you add your Nightscout Web URL and then add your Secret in NS API secret below. There is no api/v1 in it a. Set your Nightscout URL e.g., https://yoursitesname.fly.dev/ \u2301 b. You will also need to Disable Upload treatments and Back-fill data from xDrip+, or else treatments can be doubled in AAPS leading to false COB and IOB. \u2301 c. Alert on failures should also be deactivated. \u2301 These are in your settings/Cloud Upload/Nightscout Sync (REST-API) / Extra Options. d. Also Disable Automatic Calibration you can enable it for the first time but then after that it will need to be Disabled. you can do this by selecting the Download treatments to switch Automatic calibration (on/Off) \u2301 You can do this at: Settings/Cloud Upload/Nightscout Sync (REST-API) / 8. Setting up xDrip as a (follower) like for your dad from the example from above \u2301 This will be on your follower\u2019s mobile phone, not your own. 1. In the xDrip Settings / Hardware Data Source, choose \u201cNightscout Follower\u201d as the hardware data source. See xdrip - Base URL for more information \u2301 To Be continued! \u2301 Issues or Concerns \u2301 If you have any issues or concerns please post your questions in the Facebook Group or you can go to the Discussions on Github Why Not take visit UK Wide Cycle Ride - Diabetes.uk or Swim22 - Diabetes.uk for your Diabetes Needs!","title":"Fly_io"},{"location":"Nightscout/Fly_io-setup/#fly_io-for-nightscout","text":"Credit too: Big thanks to Robby, for the idea, links putting it together, implementing the installer, and testing everything with myself for the docs, and Robby for the tips.","title":"Fly_io for Nightscout"},{"location":"Nightscout/Fly_io-setup/#upcoming-changes-made","text":"Process:old heroku account to a new Turbo Fly_io Account.

After the external IP address column is finished, click on \u201cSSH\u201d on the right side of the IP address. A terminal will appear shortly. \u2301 This should bring up your browser, if it dosn't like it did not with me in firefox browser I had to allow popups for it to work! o. Copy and paste the following line into the terminal window that has just come up. Be very cautious not to copy it into any other machine as it will overwrite the contents of the machine. Copy the code below into teh teminal. \u2301 curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamorham/nightscout-vps/vps-1/bootstrap.sh | bash You might get a pop up preventing you from opening the terminal window. If you do, select the options and allow the popups window. Then select the SSH again to open it. 4. Now Wrap up Linux installation \u2301 a. If you get an error message that says (EINTEGRITY) ending with (0 bytes) and it hangs, just press CTRL and C keys at the same time to interrupt. Then, re-run the curl bootstrap command above that you have just entered into it again. You can use the up arrow on the terminal to go back to the previous command entries. \u2301 b. After the installation is finalized, you will be asked to login. To log into the virtual machine, use the email address and password you used to register from when you did your Noip Account \u2301 c.

API secret: You will be asked to replace the API secret. This is the password you will login to Nightscout with later. \u2301 Enter a password and take note of it and keep safe. It needs to be more than 12 characters long I would also not use symbols characters within making your password, I don't think xdrip likes it. Installation is Complete: When you see the following, the installation is complete and you can close the terminal by clicking on X at the top right corner of the terminal window. \u2301 5. Now We need to Set up Nightscout: \u2301 Set up Nightscout: \u2301 a. Use a web browser and copy your hostname from noip. \u2301 And Paste it into your browser. (from when you registered at noip.com). b. This will bring up your Nightscout. It will ask you for a password. Enter your API-Secret you did earlier in the Google Cloud terminal. \u2301 Check \u201cRemember this device\u201d checkbox to avoid having to re-enter it. c. On first time, Nightscout will ask you to set up a profile for sensitivity etc. Either enter real values or just click save and then use close button on top right of the screen. You may need to do this twice \u2301 6. Set up xDrip to upload to your Nightscout \u2301 This is what you need to do in xDrip on your master (Main) phone. a.

Let\u2019s say the hostname you chose when you signed up for noip.com was hostname. And let\u2019s say you set the API secret, while finalizing the installation as explained in the previous section, to API-Secret. \u2301 d. Tap on Base URL. Enter the following. https://API-Secret@hostname/api/v1/ \u2301 That\u2019s it. Your xDrip readings should now upload to your Nightscout on Google Cloud. If not triple check the way you have added your Base URL correctly, it is very case sensitive! 7. Set up xDrip uploader to go to your AndroidAPS \u2301 Basic settings for Most CGM \u2301 Warning! (I have not tested this bit on AndroidAPS so please report any issues if you have any. Links are at the bottom of the page!) This is the same has above except your Url will be your web address noip Host address, not like xdrip's where it has Both Secret and Noip host on one line, with the added api/v1 at the end of it. In AASP it is done separately, you add your Nightscout Web URL and then add your Secret in NS API secret below. There is no api/v1 in it at all. a. Set your Nightscout URL e.g. https://yoursitesname.ddns.net \u2301 b. You will also need to Disable Upload treatments and Back-fill data from xDrip+, or else treatments can be doubled in AAPS leading to false COB and IOB. \u2301 c. Alert on failures should also be deactivated. \u2301 These are in your settings/Cloud Upload/Nightscout Sync (REST-API) / Extra Options. d. Also Disable Automatic Calibration you can enable it for the first time but then after that it will need to be Disabled. you can do this by selecting the Download treatments to switch Automatic calibration (on/Off) \u2301 You can do this at: Settings/Cloud Upload/Nightscout Sync (REST-API) / 8. How to Configure DDNS (Dynamic DNS) in a Router \u2301 a. Is another issue some of you may face if you do not have a static Ip address. There is software available for you to download from noip called a Dynamic update client . \u2301 Which can be ok during the day while your computer is running but not so good at night if you wish to be saving power and turning your computer off, has this can and will stop your nightscout from running if your ip changes while your computer is off, making it an unsafe process for nightscout at night. b. The next video method is good for them that are able to use these router's but again some of us cannot use these methods and these kinds of router with a DHCP some are on routers that only have a DHCU \u2301 c. This I found very frustrating to have to go through all of this due to some Service providers preventing you having a static Ip address. And this process I hope will help resolve a lot of them for you. But again, a cost in having to buy a second router! \u2301 I did this setup running on a Hub 3.0 VMDG505/TG2492LG-VM 9. Create Acess Tokens and Roll \u2301 Set up Nightscout tokens for your followers and AndroidAPS \u2301 a. Go to your Web site Nightscout and verify again and verify API-Secret again if needed. See \"Now We need to Set up Nightscout\" above. And click on the top right menu button. \u2301 b. Click on \"Admin Tools\" \u2301 c. You will see seven predefined roles: \u2301 Roles admin: full Access Readable: read-only access; no ability to make CarePortal/treatment entries. This user can view reports and profile information. Careportal: can view the site and make CarePortal/treatment entries Denied: no access (this role only works if the AUTH_DEFAULT_ROLES setting is also denied. You can\u2019t have a site that is readable to everyone and create a \u201cdenied\u201d token for a specific user.) Devicestatus-upload: used by devices. d. Make a Token \u2301 Click the 'Add New Subject' e. In the form that opens, enter a name. Then under \u201cRoles\u201d, copy a role from the table. For example, for your dad that is only supposed to see your readings and nothing else and not be able to enter any other details or do anything else, then enter 'readable' in the roles section. \u2301 You can enter a combination of different roles by separating them with \u201c,\u201d You can also add an optional comment if you like, and then click the save button. f. The token will be displayed. You can use it in two various ways: \u2301 Now make sure to take a note of the access token, that you are given You can create multiple tokens with specific permissions for each. Note! Now make sure to take a note of the access token, that you are given. You can create multiple tokens with specific permissions for each. 10. Setting up xDrip as a (follower) like your dad, from the example above \u2301 a. In the xDrip Data Source Settings, choose \u201cNightscout Follower\u201d as the hardware data source. See xdrip - Base URL for more information \u2301 Issues or Concerns \u2301 If you have any issues or concerns please post your questions in the Facebook Group or you can go to the Discussions on Github Why Not take visit UK Wide Cycle Ride - Diabetes.uk or Swim22 - Diabetes.uk for your Diabetes Needs!","title":"Google Cloud Server Setup"},{"location":"Nightscout/Google%20Cloud_setup/#nightscout-on-google-cloud","text":"Credit too:Big thanks go to jamorham, the current xDrip head developer, for the idea, putting it together, implementing the installer, and testing everything with myself and Navid doing the documents with myself Dave!.

Once you have added your Connection string into the MongoDB_Uri. Scroll down to the bottom of the Config var list and click the Deploy APP \u2301 You will WAIT until a while for them completion. Do not stop the process until it's complete. 15. click the View button and it should come up (if not, then click the Manage App -> Open App, in the top right corner) \u2301 16. Your Nightscout site should open and direct you to fill in profile editor for Nightscout. \u2301 17. All you need to fill in at this moment in time is your Time zone and eventually all the other fields e.g. Insulin to carbs. Make sure to not leave any fields empty. If you don't understand which value to use, just use the default value . \u2301 a. You can come back and change these values later at any time by going to your Nightscout URL selecting the Hamberger icon on the right and selecting profile editor . 18. You will then need to go down to Authentication Status on the left and click Authentication. And enter your Heroku API secret you made earlier. Then click Authenticate button , Then save . \u2301 Your Privacy warning! Anyone with your URL of your Nightscout site, can view your values and run reports of your data. It is recommended that you enable security to your site once you're done this setup. 19. Dexcom Share and CareLink users should see data working after a few minutes. Other uploaders like xDrip+ , Spike , xDrip4iOS, Gimp,Tomato etc will need to be setup with a Nightscout address and API secret in each Apps settings ( See Uploaders ). \u2301 Nightscout Address for your Uploader Apps \u2301 PAPERTRAIL \u2301 a. Lastly, you might want to change the PAPERTRAIL_API_TOKEN line. Heroku gives you a free, tiny amount of Papertrail service (this is like a logging service for how the site is running), but this generates a lot of confusion to most people later on. when they get a message that their \"Free Papertrail Service has run out of room\". Papertrail is not needed at all, edit the line with the pensil icon and add DISABLED at the end, so that you can recover the function if you need it later. Congratulations Nightscout is now setup! Enable Auto Deploys in Heroku \u2301 Automatic deploys will allow you to update routinely your Heroku apps when you renew the GitHub repository. You will then not need to login into Heroku and execute Manual Deploy, as soon as do a new version of the repo be merged into GitHub an automatic deploy will trigger in all enabled Heroku apps. a) To allow automatic deploy, log in Heroku and select your app, in my case diabeticway and then selecting the Deploy section . b) Select Connect to Github c) Authenticate GitHub and your cgm-remote-monitor app are now connected. d) Click on search and add your repo name, it will then connect to Github e) Verify the master branch is selected and click Enable Automatic Deploys . f) Your site will update automatically every time you update the GitHub repository now.
