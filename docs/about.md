### About Xdrip-Android-APS-Nightscout-readthetips

 An Exciting Intro to Xdrip-Android-APS-Nightscout-readmedoc

 I started this project in 2019 trying to learn how to do it and make it which as been a task in its self, but so glad I have managed to do it. Has I progress I could see others taking this on board to start doing it them self which again is great has I found it hard to find any tips on setting all of this project up.

 I hope these tips narrow it down for you to setup xdrip and start to use what ever other devices you would like to use within xdrip, In my case I found it worked well with Omnipods and Android APS, but can work with a lot more pumps and CGM on the market today 2022


I also like to cycle to help my Diabetes at the same time in trying todo charity ride to help in charities for diabetes care and support.

 I do not get anything for helping to do these web pages, I do it soly because I'm a Type one who cares to try to help where I can.

 If you would like to help support and  sponsor me and like on what I have done on here please visit.
