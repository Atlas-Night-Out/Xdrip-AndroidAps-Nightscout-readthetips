### About Xdrip-Android-APS-Nightscout-readthetips

 An Exciting Intro to Xdrip-Android-APS-Nightscout-readmedoc

 I started this project in 2019 trying to learn how to do it and make it which as been a task in its self, but so glad I have managed to do it. Has I progress I could see others taking this on board to start doing it them self which again is great has I found it hard to find any tips on setting all of this project up.

 I hope these tips narrow it down for you to setup xdrip and start to use what ever other devices you would like to use within xdrip, In my case I found it worked well with Omnipods and Android APS, but can work with a lot more pumps and CGM on the market today 2022


I also like to cycle to help my Diabetes at the same time in trying todo charity ride to help in charities for diabetes care and support.

If you would like to sponsor me and help and like on what I have done on here please visit. I do not get anything for helping to do this, I do it because I'm a Type one who cares to try to help where I can.
