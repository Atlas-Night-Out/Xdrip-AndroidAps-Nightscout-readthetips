These docs are based on the [latest Nightly Build](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases) Which you can download from there. (allow a few days for update to take effect).  
**If you're already using xDrip+** and don't find a feature documented here and want it, you might need to [update](../../use/update) your xDrip+ app.  
See at the bottom of each page the version at which it was written, if you have an older version it might not include the feature.

**If you're completely new to xDrip+** and you want to install it for the first time continue to [prerequisites](../prerequisites) and follow the flow.

### Specifications

You need an Android phone.

* Minimum supported Android version is 4.4 but 6 and above is recommended.<br>
* If you will connect xDrip+ to a sensor your phone must support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE): you can use utilities like this one to check.<br>
* If you want to use the embedded master - follower function of xDrip+ (called xDrip+ Sync) both phones must have the Google Play Services installed.<br>
* In order to use NFC scanning features for Libre 1 and 2 (EU only) sensors, or to connect directly to a Libre 2 (EU) sensor your phone needs a compatible NFC reader.<br>
* If using Android 10 and above make sure you use a recent version of xDrip+ (at least the latest release, we'll talk about it later: continue reading).

### Translation

The documentation is only available in English for now.  
You might find it easier to follow if you [switch your xDrip+ to English](../../use/display/#language) and read it using and automatic translation with Google.
